In this exercise, we'll be working with a simplified version of an Instagram-like database schema. This schema represents the core components of a social media platform where users can post photos, like, comment, follow each other, and more.



As part of your learning journey, you'll be using a range of advanced SQL functions, including window functions, grouping, and subqueries, to perform intricate data analysis tasks on the provided database. These functions enable you to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enhancing your ability to work with real-world scenarios.



Database Schema Overview:



Here's a brief overview of the tables you'll be working with:



users: Contains user information such as usernames and creation timestamps.

photos: Stores details about posted photos, including image URLs and user IDs.

comments: Stores comments made on photos, along with associated user and photo IDs.

likes: Tracks user likes on photos.

follows: Records user follow relationships.

tags: Manages unique tag names for photos.

photo_tags: Links photos with associated tags.



Your Task:



Your task is to write SQL queries using a variety of advanced functions to extract valuable insights from the database. These insights could be used by the platform to understand user behavior, engagement, and trends. Each question is accompanied by a description of the task you need to accomplish.



Remember that this exercise is designed to elevate your proficiency in advanced SQL analytics and showcase how these concepts can be applied to practical scenarios. Feel free to experiment, collaborate, and explore different approaches to finding solutions. Let's dive into the questions and put your advanced SQL skills to the test!
